### How to use▶

  •Path: Put in the path where your world is saved! (Should be in "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\765612398874879216\SinglePlayer\0113546374")
The first number is your userid (I think) and the second number is the worldid (the world you want to add the items to)
  
  •Item: Is just the item you want to add to your inventory! If you add a Item like a chainsaw more than once to the same world then your whole inventory will be cleared!
  
  •Amount: How often do you want the item?
  
  •Then just press "Add Item" and you're done!
  
### Dont forget to create backups of your world!

### Installation▶

  •Install the .exe file from the latest release! Dont downlaod the source code(its just the readme file)
 
 
### Thats it! Have fun!
